# Computer Networks

In this repository, we aim at reviewing and learning computer networks concepts.

## What are computer networks? Why?

A computer network is simply a group of computers or devices that are connected together so they can share information and resources. These connections can be through wires, like Ethernet cables, or wireless, like Wi-Fi.

But why were networks created in the first place?
The main reason was communication and sharing. In the early days of computing, each computer worked alone, and if you wanted to send data to someone far away, you had to copy it onto a tape or disk and physically deliver it. Networks solved this problem by letting computers exchange information instantly. Scientists and engineers could share research results, programs, and even computing power without leaving their offices.

Today, networks are so important that we barely notice them — but we couldn’t live our daily lives without them. When you send a message to a friend, stream a video, play an online game, buy something from a shop on the other side of the world, or even just search for information, you are using computer networks. Banks, hospitals, airplanes, factories — almost everything depends on networks to keep working smoothly.

In short, computer networks were invented to help computers talk to each other and share resources, and now they connect the entire world.



## History
In the 1960s, scientists funded by ARPA (the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the U.S.) had a big idea: connect research computers across the country so they could share data and resources. They also wanted the system to survive failures — even if one computer or connection was shut down, the others should still work.

In 1969, their project, called ARPANET, came to life. At first, only four computers were connected — at UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah — but it was enough to show that the idea worked.

By 1973, ARPANET was using packet switching, a clever way of breaking data into small pieces and sending them through many possible routes. That same year, it even made its first international connections to Norway and London, proving this technology could go worldwide.

A big milestone came in 1983, when ARPANET switched to the TCP/IP protocol. This was like teaching all computers a common language, and it is still the language of the Internet today. Many people call this the real "birth of the Internet."

Finally, in 1990, ARPANET was retired — but by then, its ideas had spread everywhere. The Internet was growing fast. Just one year later, in 1991, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, which gave us websites, browsers, and clickable links. This made the Internet easy to use and opened the door to the connected world we have today.


## Computer networks layers
The goal of these models are to break down complex network communication into smaller, manageable parts.




### The OSI model (7 layers)

#### Physical Layer
The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the Physical Layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. The physical layer contains information in the form of bits.

Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next.

When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together.

Common physical layer devices are Hub, Repeater, Modem, and Cables.
